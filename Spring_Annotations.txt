@Component : This annotation can be used to mark beans as spring's managed component.
e.g. @Component
	 public @interface Service{
	 }
	 
	 @Component
	 public @interface Repository{
	 }

Service and Repository are special cases of @Component, they are technically same but used for different purpose.

@Service : We mark beans with @Service annotation to indicate that they contain business logic.

@Repository : The job of this annotation is to catch persistence-specific exceptions and re-throw them as one of spring's unified unchecked exceptions.
